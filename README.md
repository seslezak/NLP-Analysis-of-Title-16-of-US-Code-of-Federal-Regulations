## NLP-Analysis-of-Title-16-of-US-Code-of-Federal-Regulations

The code in the R Code file was developed to address the problem described here:

A.  After the text in each subsection is collected, tokenize the text as follows:
1.  For each subsection, split the text into a list of sentences.
2.  For each sentence, split the string into a list of tokens or ngrams

B.  Combine all ngrams into a corpus, and collect the following data:
1.  The frequency count for every ngram in the corpus
2.  The probability of each ngram in the corpus
3.  The entropy of each ngram in the corpus

The object *Code* satisfies *A1* above.  The object *CodeTokens* satisfies condition *A2*.  The object *RRPhraseTable* satisfies *B* above.



Please note the original text file used for the analysis is in this Git repo, along with a PDF of the US Code.
